# tasmota-zigbee-automation
Home automation based on Tasmota zibgee bridge and Python3.

This is the code I use for my home automation.

It is based on zigbee.

Designed to be executed on RPI, with mosquito and assistant relay.

For now, I have a Sonnof zigbee-wifi bridge.

The plan is to move to an USB zibgee stick,
but now I have only a cheap CC2531 USB dongle that is trash/not usable.
